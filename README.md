# IWC423 Advanced Database Systems: Team 1 

## Task

Our team was assigned by Prof Bhuvan to create a schema for the banking domain.

We additionally created a [mock frontend](./mock/) to show what the Bank's Portal *(using the hybrid DB approach)* for Client and Admin users could look like.

The Bank Portal is **live** at [iwc-423-team01.vercel.app/](https://iwc-423-team01.vercel.app/).

## Files

Our team's daily team journal and [code files](./sql/) are written [here](./docs/lab-notes.md).
